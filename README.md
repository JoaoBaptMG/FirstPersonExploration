# FirstPersonExplorer

This repository contains a very old project I had originally developed in Unity in 2012. It consists in a first person character that has to walk through a terrain and search for items (green cubes). The character can grab upgrades like a map, a jump enhancer and a cube detector.

This project was updated last year to Unity 2019 (since it has been created using a very old Unity version).
